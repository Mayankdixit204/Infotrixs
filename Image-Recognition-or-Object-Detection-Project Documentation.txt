Introduction

         This project focuses on image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to build a
          deep learning model that can classify images into one of ten classes: 'airplane', 'automobile',
          'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', or 'truck'. The project is divided into several stages,
          including data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

Dataset

         The dataset used in this project is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color
          images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is divided into a training set of
          50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.



Data Preprocessing



1. Loading the Dataset: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's `datasets.cifar10.load_data()`
function. It is split into training and test sets.



2.Reshaping Labels: The labels in the training set are initially in a 2D array format. They are reshaped to
a 1D array for compatibility with the model.



3.Normalization: The pixel values of the images are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 by dividing
each pixel value by 255.



Model Architecture

Two different models are implemented in this project:

   I.     Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  II.     Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)



  I.      Simple ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

         Input Layer: Flatten layer for flattening the 32x32x3 input images.
         Hidden Layers: Two dense (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation functions and 3,000 and
          1,000 neurons, respectively.
          Output Layer: Dense layer with 10 neurons (equal to the number of classes) and a softmax
           activation function for classification.

 II.       CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

          Convolutional Layers: Two sets of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. The first
           set has 32 filters, and the second set has 64 filters. Each convolutional layer uses a ReLU
           activation function.
          Flatten Layer: Flattening layer to transform the output from convolutional layers into a 1D vector.
          Dense Layers: Two dense layers with ReLU activation functions and 64 neurons for feature
           extraction.
          Output Layer: Dense layer with 10 neurons and a softmax activation function for classification.



Model Training

Simple ANN

          The simple ANN is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer and sparse
           categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. It is trained for 5 epochs.

CNN

          The CNN is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss
           function. It is trained for 10 epochs.

Evaluation

          After training, both models are evaluated on the test dataset, and the classification performance
           is assessed using classification reports.

Model Conversion to TensorFlow Lite

          The trained CNN model is converted to TensorFlow Lite format and saved as 'cnn.tflite' for
           potential use in mobile applications or other resource-constrained environments.

Label Generation



          A 'labels.txt' file is generated, containing the class labels for reference.

Project Implementation & Technologies and Tools:
               1.   Python
               2.   OpenCV
               3.   TensorFlow
               4.   Labeled datasets
               5.   Google Colab Notebook (for development and testing)
User Interface Guidelines

To run the project, follow these steps:

            1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in a compatible environment (e.g., Google Colab).
            2. Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially. This will load the data, train both
               ANN and CNN models, and export the CNN model to a TensorFlow Lite format.
            3. You can use the generated `cnn.tflite` model for deployment on various platforms or
               devices.
            4. The `labels.txt` file contains class labels associated with the CIFAR-10 dataset.



Evaluation Metrics

       The evaluation metrics used in this project include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
        These metrics are computed using the scikit-learn library's `classification_report` function.

Performance Analysis

       The performance analysis of the models is presented in the classification reports. These reports
        provide detailed information on how well the models perform in classifying images into their
        respective categories.

It seems like a Jupyter Notebook containing code for an image classification project using TensorFlow
and Keras. To document the entire project, I'll provide a breakdown of the key components and steps
involved in your code. Here's a comprehensive documentation for your project:
